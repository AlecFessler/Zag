//! Lazy FPU save/restore.
//!
//! The kernel itself is built without SSE/NEON (see `cpu_features_sub`
//! in build.zig), so user-mode FP/SIMD state survives across syscalls
//! and interrupts untouched in the CPU registers. There is no eager
//! FXSAVE/FXRSTOR on syscall entry/exit and no save/restore on context
//! switch — eviction happens only when a different EC on the same core
//! actually issues an FP/SIMD instruction and traps the FPU-disabled
//! bit (CR0.TS on x86-64, CPACR_EL1.FPEN on aarch64).
//!
//! Per core, `scheduler.core_states[core_id].last_fpu_owner` names the
//! EC whose FP regs currently live in that core's hardware. The
//! receiving-side bookkeeping in `arm` only writes the trap-arm bit
//! when the new dispatch target differs from this slot, avoiding
//! redundant CR-writes (each costs a vmexit under KVM).
//!
//! Cross-core migration: if a stolen EC's FP state still lives on a
//! different core's registers, the destination core sends an IPI to
//! the source core to FXSAVE into the EC's own buffer and clear its
//! `last_fpu_owner` slot. See `migrateFlush`.
//!
//! Spec §[execution_context] lazy FPU.
