///   2. Drop the cd lock, then fire `destroyExecutionContext`. The

///      addr-space root for kstack unmap, so it must run with the cd
///      lock released (worker.domain == caller.domain in the
///      target=self construction the spec tests use).
///
/// The caller's slot is intentionally NOT cleared here. Per spec
/// §[execution_context].terminate test 05, "syscalls invoked with any
/// handle to the terminated EC return E_TERM and remove that handle
/// from the caller's table on the same call." The kernel-table entry
/// is left pointing at the now-destroyed EC slab; the gen bump in
/// `destroyExecutionContext` flips its parity to "freed", so the next
/// syscall using this handle catches the gen mismatch via
/// `SlabRef.lock`, surfaces `E_TERM`, and lazily evicts the slot. The
/// same lazy eviction applies to stale handles in other capability
/// domains.
/// Park the calling EC out of every run queue with no possibility of
/// resuming. Used by no-route fault fallbacks (§[event_route]): when an
/// exception fires and the EC has no thread_fault route bound, the
/// kernel must keep the faulting EC from being re-dispatched. Otherwise
/// the EC re-iretq's onto the same instruction, faults again, and
/// (especially at higher-than-default priority) starves every other EC
/// in its domain. A full `destroyExecutionContext` from this path would
/// unmap the kernel stack the exception handler is currently running
/// on, so we instead clear the local core's `current_ec` slot and mark
/// the EC `.exited`. The EC's slab + stacks stay pinned until its
