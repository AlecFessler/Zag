//! AArch64 hardware virtualization primitive layer — layer-neutral types.
//!
//! This file is the base of a three-file split:
//!
//!   * `vm.zig`     — layer-neutral VM types (`GuestState`, `VmExitInfo`,
//!                    `VmPolicy`, HCR_EL2 bits, exception injection,
//!                    ESR decoding, global/per-core init, HVC ABI).
//!   * `hyp.zig`    — EL2 world-switch machinery (`vmResume`, the
//!                    `__hyp_vectors` table and HVC stubs, host-side
//!                    FPSIMD save/restore, kernel-VA→PA resolver).
//!   * `stage2.zig` — stage-2 translation tables (`VmControlBlock`,
//!                    `mapGuestPage` / `unmapGuestPage`,
//!                    `invalidateStage2Ipa`, sysreg passthrough).
//!
//! Mirrors `kernel/arch/x64/vm.zig`. Where x64 has to pick between Intel VMX
//! and AMD SVM at runtime, ARMv8-A has exactly one virtualization mechanism:
//! EL2 (the Hypervisor Exception Level), driven by system registers (no
//! VMCS/VMCB control structures). So there is no runtime backend dispatch
//! here; the EL2 helpers live in `hyp.zig` and the stage-2 page-table
//! management in `stage2.zig`.
//!
//! Architectural references (all local PDFs under `docs/aarch64/`):
//!   - ARM ARM (DDI 0487)      — the authoritative spec

//! Concept map from x86 to ARM (for reviewers coming from the x64 code):
//!   VMCS/VMCB  → a handful of EL2 system registers set directly before ERET
//!   EPT root   → VTTBR_EL2 (Virtualization Translation Table Base Register)
//!   EPT ptes   → Stage-2 descriptors (ARM ARM D5.5)
//!   VMRUN/VMRESUME → ERET from EL2 to EL1 with HCR_EL2.TGE=0
//!   VMEXIT     → exception taken to EL2 (vectored via VBAR_EL2)
//!   CR0/CR4    → SCTLR_EL1 + HCR_EL2 virtualization bits
//!   CPUID      → MRS of ID_AA64* registers, optionally trapped via HCR_EL2.TID*
//!   MSR bitmap → HCR_EL2 trap bits + per-register trap controls (no bitmap)
//!   LAPIC/IOAPIC → GICv3 virtual CPU interface (ICH_* sysregs) + emulated
