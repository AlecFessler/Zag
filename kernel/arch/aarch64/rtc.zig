//! PL031 Real Time Clock driver for AArch64.
//!
//! The PL031 is ARM's standard RTC IP used on the QEMU `virt` machine
//! (base 0x09010000) and on many physical ARM SoCs. It exposes a 32-bit
//! counter that increments once per second and is initialized by the
//! firmware to seconds-since-1970-epoch. Unlike the x86 MC146818 CMOS
//! RTC there is no BCD conversion, no per-field register layout, and
//! no UIP race window — a single 32-bit MMIO read yields the value.
//!
//! Only the read path (RTCDR) is implemented. Writing to RTCLR would
//! set the counter but the kernel's wall-clock is adjusted in
//! software above readRtc() via `clock_setwall`, so the hardware
//! counter is never written from here.
//!

//!
//! The MMIO base is set by `setBase` during ACPI parsing (or hardcoded
//! fallback for the QEMU `virt` machine, which has no ACPI table
//! advertising PL031). If the base has not been mapped, `readRtc`
//! returns 0 — the same sentinel the dispatch layer returned before
//! the driver existed.
