//! Sample-mode PMU bring-up and NMI hook.
//!
//! Compiled in only when `-Dkernel_profile=sample`. On every core the
//! PMU is programmed to count retired cycles and overflow every
//! `SAMPLE_PERIOD_CYCLES` cycles; the overflow is routed through the
//! LAPIC LVT PerfMon entry with NMI delivery mode so sampling fires
//! even when the targeted code has interrupts masked. The NMI handler
//! calls `onNmi()` with the interrupted instruction pointer and the
//! interrupted frame pointer; when `onNmi()` returns true the caller
//! treats the NMI as consumed.
//!
//! For each consumed NMI, `onNmi()` emits a leaf `sample` record
//! carrying the interrupted RIP, then walks the kernel frame-pointer
//! chain to emit up to `MAX_FRAMES` `sample_frame` records carrying
//! the saved return address at each level with a 1-based depth in
//! `arg`. All unwind reads go through `arch.pmu.readKernelU64Safe`, so
//! the handler never faults: a malformed / non-canonical / unaligned
//! frame pointer simply terminates the walk early.
//!
//! Emit happens from NMI context. The kprof log is NMI-safe by design
//! (inline BSS backing, atomic-RMW bump head), so the handler can
//! write `sample` and `sample_frame` records without any lock or
//! heap interaction.
