// Spec §[reply] reply — test 07.
//
// "[test 07] on success, the suspended EC is resumed."
//
// Strategy
//   The assertion is a liveness witness: after `reply(reply_handle)`
//   succeeds, the EC that the reply handle named must transition from
//   "suspended on a port" back to "runnable" and actually execute.
//
//   To witness "actually execute" we need an observable side effect
//   the worker EC performs only after it is resumed. The yield_03 idiom
//   applies: spawn the worker in the test EC's own capability domain
//   (target = 0) so a process-global is shared memory between the two
//   ECs, and have the worker's entry point store a sentinel into that
//   global with release ordering. The test EC then loads it with
//   acquire ordering after `reply` returns.
//
//   The recv-side scaffolding is the same shape as terminate_07:
//     - mint a port with {bind, recv} caps so recv is callable and the
//       port has a live bind-cap holder for its full lifetime (no
//       E_CLOSED on the recv path),
//     - mint a worker EC W with {term, susp} caps, restart_policy = 0,
//     - suspend(W, port) — non-blocking on the test EC since [1] != self,
//       queues W on the port,
//     - recv(port) — returns immediately, handing back the reply handle
//       id in the syscall word per §[recv],
//     - reply(reply_handle_id) — the spec line under test.
//
//   `term` is included on W so any restart-side scaffolding that fires
//   on test exit can clean up cleanly (matching the terminate_07
//   blueprint); `susp` is what authorizes the suspend syscall in step 3.
//   The `write` cap is intentionally NOT minted because reply test 06
//   asserts that without `write`, modifications written between recv
//   and reply are discarded — and this test makes none, so the absence
//   of `write` keeps the test EC honest about which spec line it is
//   asserting (test 07 is about resumption, not state propagation).
//
//   Because W has not run yet at the moment of `suspend`, the kernel
//   queues it on the port before its initial entry-point gets to
//   execute. `reply` is therefore observably the only edge that lets W
//   reach its entry point and write the sentinel. Polling for the
//   sentinel with a bounded yield loop (matching yield_03) tolerates
//   schedulers that delay the wake target onto another core or after
//   one or more reschedules.
//
//   Neutralize other reply error paths so test 07 is the only spec
//   assertion exercised:
//     - test 01 (E_BADCAP for invalid reply handle): the reply handle id
//       is the one the kernel just minted via recv, so it is valid.
//     - test 02 (E_INVAL for reserved bits): the wrapper masks the
//       handle to its 12-bit slot id with no upper bits set.
//     - test 03 (E_TERM if W was terminated before reply): the test
//       does not terminate W between recv and reply.
//     - test 04 (handle consumed on success): not exercised here, but
//       does not affect this test's pass/fail.
//     - tests 05/06 (state propagation gated by `write`): no event-state
//       vregs are modified between recv and reply.
//
// Action
//   1. create_port(caps={bind,recv})        — must succeed
//   2. create_execution_context(target=self,
//        entry=&workerEntry, caps={term,susp}, restart_policy=0)
//                                            — must succeed
//   3. suspend(W, port)                      — must return OK
//      (W is queued as a suspended sender on the port)
//   4. recv(port)                            — must return OK and yield
//      a reply_handle_id in the syscall word per §[recv]
//   5. reply(reply_handle_id)                — must return OK
//      (the spec line under test)
//   6. bounded yield-and-load loop on the sentinel — must observe
//      SENTINEL before the bound is exhausted
//
// Assertions
//   1: setup port creation failed (createPort returned an error word)
//   2: setup EC creation failed (createExecutionContext returned an
//      error word)
//   3: suspend itself did not return OK
//   4: recv did not return OK
//   5: reply did not return OK
//   6: sentinel was not visible after the bounded yield-and-load loop
//      (W was not actually resumed)
