// Spec §[timer] timer_rearm — test 05 (degraded smoke for cross-domain
// half).
//
// "[test 05] on success, the calling domain's copy of [1] has
//  `field0 = 0` immediately on return; every other domain-local copy
//  returns 0 from a fresh `sync` within a bounded delay."
//
// Strategy
//   The assertion is in two halves:
//
//     (a) The calling domain's own cap-table slot for the timer
//         handle has `field0 = 0` immediately on return from
//         `timer_rearm`. This half is fully testable in-process: the
//         kernel writes through to the read-only-mapped cap table at
//         `cap_table_base`, and we read it back the instant the
//         syscall returns.
//
//     (b) Every *other* domain-local copy of the same timer handle
//         returns 0 from a fresh `sync` within a bounded delay. This
//         half requires at least two capability domains each holding
//         a copy of the same timer handle. The runner spawns one
//         child capability domain per test ELF (see
//         runner/primary.zig), so there is no second domain to hold
//         a sibling copy from inside this test. The cross-domain
//         half is therefore structurally unreachable from a single
//         test ELF on this branch and is not asserted here.
//
//   To make the (a) half meaningful we drive the timer into a state
//   where field0 is *not* zero before calling `timer_rearm`, then
//   verify the rearm resets it. Sequence:
//
//     1. `timer_arm` with periodic = 1 and a small `deadline_ns` so
//        the kernel will increment field0 in the background.
//     2. Bounded poll on the cap-table slot waiting for
//        `field0 >= 1`. The eager-propagation rule
//        (§[timer] field0: "eagerly propagated to every domain-local
//        copy of the handle") guarantees the kernel writes the
//        increment back to our cap-table slot without us having to
//        call `sync`. Cap on the spin so a slow host doesn't hang
//        the test forever; if the spin exhausts we still proceed —
//        even with field0 = 0 going in, the rearm post-condition
//        (field0 = 0 on return) is still verifiable, just less
//        load-bearing.
//     3. `timer_rearm` on the live timer handle with the same
//        periodic flag. Per the spec sentence above, the calling
//        domain's copy of field0 must read 0 on the very next
//        access.
//     4. Read the cap table and assert field0 == 0.
//
//   For `timer_rearm` itself we want every error path to be
//   unreachable so the success contract is the only path:
//
//     - [1] is the handle returned by step 1's `timer_arm`, valid
//       with `arm` cap set, so tests 01 (BADCAP) and 02 (PERM) cannot
//       fire.
//     - [2] deadline_ns is non-zero, so test 03 cannot fire.
//     - [3] flags has only bit 0 (`periodic`) potentially set; all
//       other bits clear. The handle id syscall slot has its 12-bit
//       id in the low bits and zeros above, so test 04 (reserved
//       bits in [1] or [3]) cannot fire.
//
//   That leaves the success path as the only spec-mandated outcome
//   and the field0 = 0 post-condition as the only thing to check.
//
// Action
//   1. timer_arm(caps={arm}, deadline_ns = ARM_DEADLINE_NS,
//                flags = periodic) — must succeed
//   2. Bounded spin reading cap_table[timer].field0 until it is
//      >= 1 or the spin budget exhausts.
//   3. timer_rearm(timer, deadline_ns = REARM_DEADLINE_NS,
//                  flags = periodic) — must succeed
//   4. readCap(cap_table_base, timer).field0 — must equal 0
//
// Assertions
//   1: setup syscall failed (timer_arm returned an error word in vreg 1)
//   2: timer_rearm returned non-OK in vreg 1
//   3: post-rearm field0 is non-zero in the calling domain's
//      cap-table copy (violates the "field0 = 0 immediately on
//      return" half of test 05)
