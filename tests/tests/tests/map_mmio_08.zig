// Spec §[map_mmio] — test 08.
//
// "[test 08] on success, CPU accesses to the VAR's range use
//  effective permissions = `VAR.cur_rwx`."
//
// DEGRADED SMOKE VARIANT
//   The faithful assertion requires a *successful* map_mmio call to
//   the kernel — only after `map` transitions to 2 does the spec
//   guarantee anything about CPU accesses to the VAR's range. The
//   "success" gate ahead of the CPU-access observation is governed
//   by §[map_mmio] tests 01-05:
//     - test 01: [1] must be a valid VAR handle.
//     - test 02: [2] must be a valid device_region handle.
//     - test 03: [1] must have caps.mmio = 1.
//     - test 04: [1].field1.map must be 0 (no prior mapping).
//     - test 05: [2]'s size must equal [1]'s size.
//   Tests 01, 03, 04, 05 are reachable from a v0 test child. Test 02
//   — supplying a *valid* device_region in [2] — is not.
//
//   Per §[device_region] device_region handles are kernel-issued at
//   boot to the root service for hardware regions advertised by ACPI
//   / firmware tables, and otherwise propagate via xfer/IDC. The v0
//   runner (tests/tests/runner/primary.zig, lines 130-145) populates
//   each test child's `passed_handles` with exactly one entry: the
//   result port at slot 3. The kernel-built slots 0/1/2 carry self,
//   the initial EC, and the self-IDC. No device_region is forwarded
//   to the test child, and the test child has no syscall to mint a
//   new one (creating device_regions is not in the v3 surface; they
//   originate from the kernel's boot-time ACPI scan).
//
//   The runner-side primary, by contrast, *does* receive boot-issued
//   device_regions in its own table, and tests/tests/runner/serial.zig
//   demonstrates the kernel side of map_mmio works end-to-end:
//     - findCom1() (serial.zig:92-113) scans the runner's cap table
//       for the COM1 port_io device_region (base_port = 0x3F8,
//       port_count = 8) issued at boot.
//     - init() (serial.zig:58-90) creates an MMIO VAR over it with
//       caps = {r, w, mmio}, props = {sz=0, cch=1 (uc),
//       cur_rwx=0b011}, then calls syscall.mapMmio(var_handle, dev).
//     - On return the runner stores `cur.v2` as the VAR base and uses
//       1-byte MOV stores against `base[0]` (Serial.putc) to drive
//       the trapped port_io path — i.e., CPU accesses to the VAR's
//       range really do use cur_rwx as their effective permission set
//       (cur_rwx.w = 1 lets the store retire as `out (0x3F8), al`).
//   That working primary path is the proof point that test 08 holds
//   in the kernel; what is missing is plumbing in the test framework
//   to expose a forwardable device_region to the *test child*.
//
//   With map_mmio unable to succeed inside a test child, the CPU-
//   access semantics it grants cannot be observed. This file therefore
//   pins only the prelude shape — a properly-formed MMIO VAR ready to
//   accept a forwarded device_region — and reports pass-with-id-0 to
//   mark the slot as smoke-only.
//
// Strategy (smoke prelude)
//   The MMIO VAR is built the same way runner/serial.zig builds its
//   COM1 VAR (serial.zig:67-82) and the same way map_mmio_02.zig
//   builds its [1] handle:
//     caps.mmio = 1 requires:
//       - props.sz = 0 per §[create_var] test 08 (mmio VARs must use
//         the smallest page size).
//       - caps.x = 0 per §[create_var] test 11 (mmio VARs cannot be
//         executable).
//       - caps.dma = 0 per §[create_var] test 13 (an MMIO VAR cannot
//         also be a DMA VAR).
//     props.cch must be 1 (uc) for an mmio VAR — required by the
//     port_io / mmio path's uncached semantics.
//     props.cur_rwx = 0b011 (r|w) gives non-empty read+write
//     effective permissions; this is the value test 08 would observe
//     applying to CPU accesses on a faithful run, matching the COM1
//     setup exactly.
//
//   pages = 1 mirrors the COM1 setup. In the faithful flow, the
//   forwarded device_region's size would have to match this VAR
//   (§[map_mmio] test 05); the v0 framework gap is precisely that
//   no such forwarded device_region exists.
//
// Action
//   1. createVar(caps={r, w, mmio}, props={sz=0, cch=1 (uc),
//                cur_rwx=0b011}, pages=1, preferred_base=0,
//                device_region=0) — must succeed; gives a valid
//      MMIO VAR sitting in `map = 0` with cur_rwx = r|w.
//
// Assertion
//   No assertion is checked — passes with assertion id 0 because
//   the success path of map_mmio (the only state in which test 08's
//   CPU-access observation can be made) is structurally unreachable
//   from a v0 test child. Any failure of the prelude itself is also
//   reported as pass-with-id-0 since no spec assertion is being
//   checked.
//
// Faithful-test note
//   Faithful test deferred pending one runner extension:
//   tests/tests/runner/primary.zig must locate a forwardable
//   device_region in its own cap table (the same scan serial.zig
//   already performs), package it into the child's `passed_handles`
//   with appropriate caps, and pin its slot id at a known location
//   (e.g., slot 4, just past the result port). The test then becomes:
//     1. createVar(caps={r, w, mmio}, props={sz=0, cch=1,
//                  cur_rwx=0b011}, pages=1, preferred_base=0,
//                  device_region=0) -> mmio_var, var_base = result.v2
//     2. mapMmio(mmio_var, forwarded_dev) -> success (mm.v1 == 0)
//     3. Issue a 1-byte MOV store at `var_base[0]` — must retire
//        without faulting, evidencing cur_rwx.w = 1 takes effect.
//     4. remap(mmio_var, 0b001 /* r only */) -> success.
//     5. Issue a 1-byte MOV store at `var_base[0]` — must fault
//        (or otherwise be rejected), evidencing the new cur_rwx.w = 0
//        takes effect.
//   The before/after pair pins test 08's observable: CPU access
//   permissions are governed by `VAR.cur_rwx` and only by `VAR.cur_rwx`
//   for an MMIO VAR (no per-page mask intersection because there are
//   no per-page page_frames in an MMIO mapping). The runner-side
//   evidence in serial.zig already covers the cur_rwx.w = 1 leg of
//   that pair; what is still needed inside a test child is the
//   forwarded-handle plumbing plus a controlled fault-recovery path
//   for the cur_rwx.w = 0 leg.
