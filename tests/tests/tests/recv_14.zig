// Spec §[recv] recv — test 14.
//
// "[test 14] on success, until the reply handle is consumed, the
//  dequeued sender remains suspended; deleting the reply handle
//  resolves the sender with E_ABANDONED."
//
// Strategy
//   The assertion has two halves and a single setup can witness both:
//     (a) After recv mints the reply handle, the dequeued sender stays
//         suspended until the reply handle is consumed.
//     (b) Deleting the reply handle (one of the two consume paths;
//         `reply` is the other) resumes the sender with E_ABANDONED.
//
//   Producing a sender that observably reports E_ABANDONED requires the
//   sender to *itself* call `suspend(self, port)` so that there is a
//   blocked syscall whose return value is the kernel's resolution
//   verdict. recv_07's pattern (test EC issues `suspend(W, port)` with
//   [1] != self) queues W as a suspended sender but W never made a
//   syscall — there is no syscall return for the kernel to resolve, so
//   E_ABANDONED is not directly observable. recv_14 instead spawns a
//   worker EC W in the same capability domain, hands W the slot id of
//   its own EC handle through a shared global, and has W issue
//   `suspend(self_slot, port)` from `workerEntry`. That is the syscall
//   the kernel resumes with E_ABANDONED on delete; W stores the result
//   in a shared global before halting.
//
//   Witness for (a). Yield to the worker so it reaches the blocking
//   suspend syscall. After recv returns to the test EC, yield to W
//   again and observe `worker_done == 0` — W has not yet returned from
//   suspend. Per §[capabilities] line 176, the only paths that resolve
//   the suspended sender are reply on the reply handle and delete on
//   the reply handle; the test has done neither between recv and this
//   probe, so any non-zero `worker_done` here would falsify "remains
//   suspended until the reply handle is consumed."
//
//   Witness for (b). After observing (a), call `delete(reply_handle)`.
//   Per §[capabilities] line 176 ("If the suspended sender is still
//   waiting, resume them with E_ABANDONED. Release handle"), the
//   kernel resumes W's `suspend` syscall with E_ABANDONED in vreg 1.
//   W captures that into `worker_result`, releases `worker_done`, and
//   halts. The test EC bounded-yield-polls `worker_done`; on
//   observation the recorded result must equal E_ABANDONED.
//
//   Both ECs run in the same capability domain (target=0 on the
//   create_execution_context call), so they share the address space —
//   `worker_self_slot`, `worker_result`, and `worker_done` are
//   process-global side channels reachable from both ends. The handle
//   table is also shared, so the slot id the test EC sees for W is the
//   same id W uses on its self-suspend.
//
//   Pre-call gates the test must clear so no other failure path can
//   mask the assertion under test:
//     - §[create_port] tests 01-04: runner self-handle has `crpt`,
//       caps {bind,recv} ⊆ port_ceiling, no reserved bits set.
//     - §[create_execution_context] tests 01,03,06,08,09,10: runner
//       self-handle has `crec`; w_caps ⊆ ec_inner_ceiling; priority 0;
//       stack_pages 1; affinity 0; reserved bits clear.
//     - §[suspend] tests 01-07 from W's side:
//         test 01 (E_BADCAP): W reads worker_self_slot, which the
//           test EC publishes from the createExecutionContext result.
//         test 02 (E_BADCAP for [2]): port slot is the freshly-minted
//           handle id captured by the test EC.
//         test 03 (E_PERM no `susp`): w_caps.susp = true.
//         test 04 (E_PERM no `bind` on port): port_caps.bind = true.
//         test 05 (reserved bits): syscall.suspendEc zero-fills.
//         test 06 (vCPU): W is a regular EC.
//         test 07 (already suspended): W is freshly created and never
//           prior-suspended.
//     - §[recv] tests 01-06 from the test EC's side:
//         01 (BADCAP): port_handle is the freshly-minted handle.
//         02 (no `recv` cap): port_caps.recv = true.
//         03 (reserved bits): libz wrapper takes u12 and zero-extends.
//         04 (E_CLOSED no bind/route/queue): the test EC holds the
//           port handle with the bind cap, and W queues a suspension
//           event before the test EC recvs.
//         05 (E_CLOSED on blocked recv when bind drops): the test EC
//           never deletes the port handle.
//         06 (E_FULL): the test domain has plenty of free slots for
//           the reply handle and the zero attached handles.
//
// Action
//   1. create_port(caps={bind, recv})            — must succeed
//   2. create_execution_context(target=self, caps={susp, term, rp=0},
//        entry=&workerEntry, stack_pages=1, affinity=0)
//                                                 — must succeed
//   3. publish worker_self_slot, worker_port_slot to W; yield(W)
//      so W reaches its blocking suspend syscall (best-effort —
//      multi-core may run W concurrently; either path resolves to W
//      blocked on the port by the time recv runs)
//   4. recv(port)                                — must return OK
//      (test EC holds the port's bind cap → no E_CLOSED; reply slot
//      and zero attached handles fit easily → no E_FULL)
//   5. yield(W); witness (a) — `worker_done` must still be 0
//   6. delete(reply_handle)                      — must return OK
//   7. bounded yield-and-poll on `worker_done`; on observation
//      `worker_result` must equal E_ABANDONED — witness (b)
//
// Assertions
//   1: setup port creation failed (createPort returned an error word)
//   2: setup EC creation failed (createExecutionContext returned an
//      error word)
//   3: pre-recv yield to the worker did not return OK
//   4: recv did not return OK
//   5: post-recv `worker_done` was non-zero — the dequeued sender did
//      not remain suspended until the reply handle was consumed
//   6: delete on the reply handle did not return OK
//   7: worker did not signal completion within the bounded poll window
//   8: worker observed something other than E_ABANDONED on its
//      blocked suspend — deleting the reply handle did not resolve
//      the sender with E_ABANDONED
