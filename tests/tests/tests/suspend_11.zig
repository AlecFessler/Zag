// Spec §[suspend] — test 11.
//
// "[test 11] on success, when [1] has the `write` cap, modifications
//  written to the event payload are applied to the target's EC state on
//  reply; otherwise modifications are discarded."
//
// Strategy
//   The assertion needs a witness that proves a modification written by
//   the receiver between `recv` and `reply` lands on the suspended EC's
//   state when (and only when) the EC handle that triggered the
//   suspension carries the `write` cap. The cleanest user-visible
//   probe is a GPR: §[event_state] maps vreg 13 to r15 on x86-64, and
//   r15 is not used by libz for any wrapper machinery, so loading a
//   sentinel into v13 at reply time and having the resumed EC publish
//   r15 to a shared memory location is a direct read-out of the kernel
//   having applied the modification.
//
//   The test EC owns both ends of the pipeline:
//     - It mints a port with `bind | recv`.
//     - It mints a worker EC W with target = self (so W lives in the
//       same address space and can touch globals declared in this
//       file). W is given `susp + write` caps so suspending it routes
//       through the write-cap branch under test.
//     - W's entry function spins on a global `g_released` flag,
//       reads its r15 once `g_released` is non-zero, publishes the
//       value to a global `g_observed`, and halts.
//     - The test EC calls `suspend(W, port)` — W is queued as a
//       suspended sender and stops executing somewhere inside its
//       spin loop.
//     - The test EC calls `recv(port)` — the kernel hands back W's
//       captured GPR snapshot in vregs 1..13 plus a reply handle id
//       in the syscall word.
//     - The test EC sets `g_released = 1` so that, once W is
//       resumed, it immediately exits the spin loop and proceeds to
//       publish r15.
//     - The test EC issues `reply` with vreg 13 loaded with a
//       sentinel value `MAGIC`. By the spec line under test, the
//       kernel applies vreg 13 to W's r15 because W's EC handle had
//       the `write` cap.
//     - The test EC spin-waits on `g_observed`; when it lands on
//       `MAGIC` the modification has been observed end-to-end.
//
//   The sibling assertion (suspend_12: write-cap absent → modifications
//   discarded) is a separate test file. This file exercises only the
//   write-cap-present branch.
//
// Why r15 (vreg 13) and not a lower-numbered GPR
//   libz's `issueReg` puts the syscall input vregs into hardware GPRs
//   (rax, rbx, rdx, rbp, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, r12, r13, r14, r15) so
//   that *all 13* are loaded at syscall entry. v1 already carries the
//   reply handle id; v3/v4 are the result-encoding lane the runner
//   expects when the test EC eventually pass()/fail()s. r15 / vreg 13
//   is the highest-numbered GPR-backed lane, sits clear of those
//   conventions, and is the easiest to read out from the worker via a
//   single `mov %%r15, ...` inline asm.
//
// Why target=self for W
//   `create_execution_context` with [4] = 0 places W in the test's own
//   capability domain. That keeps W's entry inside the test ELF's
//   text (no need to set up a separate page frame / loader) and lets
//   W and the test EC share globals via .data. Both required caps
//   (`susp` and `write`) are within the runner's `ec_inner_ceiling`
//   which spans bits 0-7 of EcCap (move/copy/saff/spri/term/susp/read/
//   write) per primary.zig.
//
// Why a runtime spin instead of `hlt`
//   `hlt` from CPL3 #GPs (and we'd need `bind`/event-route plumbing to
//   surface that as a fault event the test could observe). A bounded
//   busy-wait on a u64 with `pause` keeps W in a predictable state
//   (i.e., touching no GPRs other than the loop addr/value pair) and
//   leaves r15 free for the kernel to overwrite at resume.
//
// Action
//   1. create_port(caps={bind, recv})             — must succeed
//   2. create_execution_context(target=self,
//        caps={susp, write, restart_policy=0})    — must succeed
//   3. suspend(W, port)                           — must return OK
//   4. recv(port)                                 — must return OK
//   5. set g_released = 1                         — local store
//   6. reply(reply_handle, vreg13 = MAGIC)        — must return OK,
//                                                   carrying the
//                                                   modification
//   7. spin until g_observed != 0                 — bounded by W's
//                                                   wakeup latency
//   8. assert g_observed == MAGIC                 — the spec line
//
// Assertions
//   1: create_port returned an error word
//   2: create_execution_context returned an error word
//   3: suspend did not return OK
//   4: recv did not return OK
//   5: reply did not return OK
//   6: g_observed differed from MAGIC after W resumed (the kernel
//      either dropped the modification entirely or applied a
//      different value)
//
// SPEC AMBIGUITY
//   §[event_state] (line 1852) says GPR-lane vregs are "1:1 with
//   hardware registers during handler execution." It does not pin
//   whether the kernel snapshots GPRs at recv time or whether the
//   recv path simply leaves the suspended EC's GPRs sitting in the
//   physical registers across the context switch. Either reading
//   yields the same observable behavior for this test: the value the
//   receiver places into its v13 input when issuing `reply` is what
//   ends up in W's r15 on resume.
