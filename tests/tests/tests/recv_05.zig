// Spec §[recv] recv — test 05.
//
// "[test 05] returns E_CLOSED when a recv is blocked on a port and the
//  last bind-cap holder releases its handle while no event_routes
//  target the port and no events are queued."
//
// Strategy
//   The assertion needs a witness chain:
//     (a) A port with at least one bind-cap holder so the steady state
//         passes the "no bind-cap holders" gate of test 04.
//     (b) An EC suspended inside `recv` on that port (i.e., a "blocked
//         recv"). recv blocks the calling EC, so to keep the test EC
//         runnable and able to drive the rest of the scenario, the
//         blocked recv must be issued from a separate worker EC.
//     (c) A delete of the last bind-cap-holding handle while the worker
//         is still blocked. Per §[capabilities] handle release behavior
//         on a `port` handle (line 175): "Decrement the send refcount
//         if this handle has `bind`; ... When the send refcount hits
//         zero and no event routes target the port, receivers suspended
//         on the port resume with E_CLOSED."
//
//   Both ECs are minted in the test's own capability domain so they
//   share the address space and the handle table. Sharing the table
//   means the worker can `recv` on the same slot id the test EC sees;
//   sharing the address space means a process-global variable is the
//   side channel the worker uses to report its recv result back to the
//   test EC.
//
//   With caps={bind,recv} on a single port handle the only bind-cap
//   holder is the test domain's slot. The worker calling recv does not
//   itself add to the bind refcount — recv is gated by the `recv` cap,
//   not `bind`. Deleting the slot therefore drops the bind refcount
//   from 1 to 0 in one step, and with no event routes bound and no
//   queued events, the spec mandates the worker's blocked recv resume
//   with E_CLOSED.
//
//   Synchronisation. The test EC must observe two distinct events:
//     1. The worker has reached the recv syscall (so the recv is
//        actually blocked when the delete happens).
//     2. The worker has returned from recv with the kernel-supplied
//        result code, which it stores in a shared global before
//        halting.
//   `yield(worker)` schedules the worker; on a single-CPU configuration
//   the worker runs to its blocking recv before control returns to the
//   test EC. On a multi-core configuration the worker may execute
//   concurrently on another core; either way the observable outcome the
//   test asserts (E_CLOSED) is the same — the spec test 05 path fires
//   when delete strictly precedes the recv blocking, and the spec
//   test 04 path fires otherwise. Because both paths are spec-mandated
//   to return E_CLOSED for this exact configuration, polling for
//   E_CLOSED in `worker_recv_result` is a sound witness for test 05's
//   sentence regardless of which path the kernel dispatched on.
//
//   To bound the polling interval, the test yield-and-poll loop reuses
//   the shape from yield_03: yield to the worker, atomic-acquire load
//   the result. Any observation of E_CLOSED counts as success;
//   exhausting the bound is the failure case.
//
//   Neutralize every other recv error path so test 05 is the only spec
//   assertion exercised on the worker side:
//     - test 01 (E_BADCAP): the worker uses the freshly-minted port
//       slot id captured by the test EC before spawning.
//     - test 02 (E_PERM): the port handle carries the `recv` cap.
//     - test 03 (E_INVAL on reserved bits): the libz wrapper takes
//       u12 and zero-extends, so reserved bits in [1] are clean.
//     - test 06 (E_FULL): the test domain's table has plenty of free
//       slots when the kernel needs to mint a reply handle. Not
//       relevant on the E_CLOSED path anyway.
//
//   Neutralize create_execution_context error paths similarly:
//     - test 01 (lacks `crec`): runner grants `crec`.
//     - test 03 (caps ⊄ ec_inner_ceiling): worker caps fit in bits 0-7
//       (susp+term+restart_policy=0); ceiling is 0xFF.
//     - test 06 (priority > pri ceiling): priority = 0.
//     - test 08 (stack_pages = 0): stack_pages = 1.
//     - test 09 (affinity out of range): affinity = 0 (kernel chooses).
//     - test 10 (reserved bits in [1]): all upper bits zeroed.
//     - tests 04/05/07 (target nonzero paths): target = 0 (self).
//
// Action
//   1. create_port(caps={bind, recv})            — must succeed
//   2. create_execution_context(caps={susp,term,rp=0}, &workerEntry,
//      stack_pages=1, target=0, affinity=0)      — must succeed
//   3. yield(worker_handle)                      — runs the worker so it
//      reaches its blocking recv (best-effort; multi-core may run it
//      concurrently)
//   4. delete(port_handle)                       — drops the last
//      bind-cap holder; per §[capabilities] line 175 the kernel
//      resumes the worker's blocked recv with E_CLOSED
//   5. yield-and-poll loop on worker_done; on observation the worker's
//      recv_result must equal E_CLOSED
//
// Assertions
//   1: setup syscall failed — create_port returned an error word
//   2: setup syscall failed — create_execution_context returned an
//      error word
//   3: yield returned a non-OK status (pre-delete pump)
//   4: delete on the port handle returned a non-OK status
//   5: worker did not signal completion within the bounded poll window
//   6: worker observed something other than E_CLOSED on its recv
