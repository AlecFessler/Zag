- need to define x64 interrupt frame
- need to define arch.registerInterrupt(vector, handler)
- vector should be a generic enum that identifies the handlers purpose
- the handler should take a struct specific to that handler that provides details about the fault, including anyopaque ptr to arch specific interrupt frame
- the arch impls should map the vector to their internal vector
- the arch impls should build a handler that takes their interrupt frame
- need to implement handlers (at least page fault and sched timer)

- need to implement arch agnostic memory subsystem init
- need to copy over the rest of the memory subsystem files

- need to cleanup acpi parsing code, archInit will probably need xsdp ptr
- need to implement arch.getInterruptTimer (will do all timer initialization)
- need to reimplement scheduler code

MISC:
- There's probably a lot of missing cpu.zig definitions still
- Panic handler code, should use dwarf info now
