- the handler should take a struct specific to that handler that provides details about the fault, including anyopaque ptr to arch specific interrupt frame
- the arch impls should build a handler that takes their interrupt frame
- need to implement handlers (at least page fault and sched timer)

- need to implement arch.getInterruptTimer (will do all timer initialization)
- need to reimplement scheduler code
